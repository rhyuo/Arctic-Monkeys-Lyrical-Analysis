This project focuses specifically on the Arctic Monkeys to function as a case study of the development of themes through an artist’s career and see how their lyrics and thematic choices develop through their career. I compared the thematic choices to their peak chart positions to attempt to find conclusions on how thematic choices impact popularity. To perform this case study, I used a data set pulled from Kaggle that contains a table with their entire repertoire.

The specific research question tackled is: “Can the content of an artist's work determine drug and/or alcohol abuse? Furthermore, do these themes affect the popularity of the music?”

Furthermore, I looked into the thematic choices and attempted to find meaningful conclusions drawn from bar plots and word clouds of word frequency and length. I compared this to the popularity of the albums and see if any themes were more popular than others. I expect that there will be some talk about drug usage, but it won't be that overwhelming. My prediction is their music has more to do with heartbreak, loneliness, and escapism than anything.

Throughout the analysis of each album, I found that some common words appeared throughout the albums. What I found was that it was hard to come up with exact themes or ideas because words alone can mean a lot of things. When I analyzed the word lengths, I found that it was easier to find descriptor words that pointed toward themes. While looking at word clouds it was much easier to see the words that stood out the most. In my opinion, this is probably the best way to understand themes. By the end, my expectations were proven somewhat correct. What I mean specifically is that the words that came up frequently were often concerning topics of love, thinking, and expressing emotion. The words that came up as the longest words typically were more negative. In regards to drug usage, the usage of drugs is not supported by the word frequencies and lengths which I analyzed. These themes were minimally used and while it may have shown up, it wasn't enough to be substantial. When looking at the themes for the most popular albums, Favourite Worst Nightmare & AM, it could be concluded that the albums were more about love and loneliness rather than drug usage.

An important aspect to acknowledge is that without more research it is impossible to come to any conclusive results. The findings of the project can be used to point to very emotional themes, but without more context, it is impossible to draw any conclusions about any kind of correlation. While the words that come up through the research in this project may seem to point towards a particular theme, it is not possible to conclude anything substantial because someone else looking at the data I provided may think other words correlate more or have more impact on the theme. This is to say it is very subjective.
